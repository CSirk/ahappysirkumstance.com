                                My rival, role model, and older brother. Jed challenges me to be better every day of my life by direct competition in things we enjoy. Jed trains for and runs marathons, I tell him how much weight I lifted that day. I tell Jed that I dont run from anyone so I have no reason to train at running, Jed tells me that's because I would pass out if i tried to. Jed is an amazing brother who I have always looked up to and who has always set an amazing example for me. Jed and I always have the best possible times when we are together and share infinite interests! We always find new and exciting things to do. Also, how many people can say they have been interviewed by a news station with "jerseys" they painted on themselves? Jed and I can! The image above shows exactly that, Jed and i getting interviewed by a news station in Chicago with painted on Chicago Fire "jerseys" (we each painted each other's on). #micdrop! If I had to pick a guy to stand beside me against any challenge, it's him everytime. Jed is the best brother in the world (besides me of course) :-)  and he is also the perfect best man to stand beside me on my big day. #lbl #longbeachlemons

                            <h2>Pretty Little Liars begins the story of Dimitric and I. We got to know each other through working for housing at UT Martin one summer, and boy.. did we pack a lifetime's worth of fun and stories into that summer! From playing tag in the halls, to dancing in the security cameras, to volleyball every night, to watching movies (and yes dimitric we did watch that one movie you swear we didnt, i swear!), to overall becoming best friends. We have been through quite a lot together and although we dont see each other as much as we used to (literally about once or more an hour for a year and a half) when we do see each other all those memories come flooding back and it feels like we are in college again. Also most people know the "Wobble" is my jam, well you are currently reading about the person who took me from step follower to the guy jumping onto the dance floor when it comes on! Dimitric is amazing at dancing and when he gets in the zone, just stand back and watch him work! I may also ask Dimitric to run security at my wedding since I have heard him get stern with people when needed, he is always ready to lay down the law with a firm "Hey!!! You there!!! Stop that!!!". #insidejokes

                            <h2>Ah Marvin, aka MVP, aka Agent Palmer. Marvin goes by many names, but all of them translate into one super awesome guy. I met Marvin about 4 years ago when I started working at HealthTrust. Now we are working on the same team as software developers, and Marvin is my team lead (the best team lead imaginable). More than just a coworker (shudder) though, Marvin is my very close friend. Marvin is one of the few people who I can truly talk to about anything at all that is going on in life. Marvin and I embody the idea of a "bromance", we completely feed off and compliment each other, and when you get the two of us in a room we are going to make constant inside jokes. Oh and get us together and watch out because we are smooth! We could sell ice to a penguin! I know that at any given time if i need something I can pick up the phone and get a "Hey Man" and have an awesome guy who always has my back on the other end of the line. Oh and hashtag game strong too. #BVM #STT #UGB #NaturalWobble #YouPaintedBro #ShareACoke</h2>

                                Kacey is one of my cousins, but honestly, growing up with her, I never really saw her that way. She’s been my best friend since as far back as I can remember. We are only 5 months apart and grew up doing so much together. We danced to the Tootsie Roll, played hide and seek, named ourselves “Cool Teenagers”, had so many sleepovers I couldn’t keep count, traveled places together, and have gone through some great times and some bad times. We always pick back up right where we left off no matter how much time has passed. We share a love of the Nashville Predators and all things 90’s! It was no surprise who I would choose to be my Matron of Honor and I couldn’t have asked for a better one! Even though Kacey lives in Colorado, she has been so helpful throughout my wedding planning. She helped me pick out the bridesmaid dresses using Facetime and constantly checks in to see where I am in my planning process and reminding me to stay on track. Without her, I’m not sure I would be ready for my big day! She has been so amazing to me!

                                I met Whitney almost 3 years ago when I started working at HUB. Whitney was responsible for teaching all the newbies the ropes so I never left Whitney’s desk for a whole month (even during lunch, when I’m sure Whitney probably didn’t want me around). I was a lost puppy and it’s in Whitney’s nature to help. I eventually annoyed her so much, she had no choice but to become my friend. She’s been such a great friend to me the past 3 years. We have shared a love of essential oils, Posh products, spending our lunches buying things we don’t need at Target and enjoying countless lunches at Fulin’s. Our cubicles are next to each other, which makes it easy to torment each other daily, but I couldn’t get through a day of work without her. She has a heart of gold and a great personality (lol). When you meet her, you will instantly know how just how great she is.

                                Before Baylee came into this world I was the only grandchild on my mom’s side for 12 years. Well Baylee messed that up for me and I had to share the spotlight and me being an only child that was not okay with me. I’m totally kidding! I was so excited when Baylee came along and have loved having her in my life ever since. She is incredibly smart and growing up way too fast! I enjoy being around her because she always wants to do something, like play games or go outside and be active. I have many embarrassing stories I could share, but I will save those for future boyfriends. We send each other random Snapchats and those always make my day brighter! It’s been awesome watching her grow up and I cannot wait to see her chase her dreams and one day work for NASA. She is really going to be reaching for the stars!
