Talking about myself has always been a weird concept to me. I never know where to start, so I’ll do my best here. I’ve never really thought of myself as an average girl. I grew up wanting to be a Disney princess. In kindergarten when everyone wanted to be doctors or policeman, I wanted to be Esmeralda (yes, I know she is not a princess, but you get the idea). My parents have home videos of me singing along to The Little Mermaid and quoting Beauty and the Beast. I grew up in Tennessee, but felt I should have been born by the beach. It’s the one place I’ve always felt I had a connection to. My favorite animal is a sea turtle and I hope to one day help rescue them. I love to travel and was so happy Cody shared this love. We travel to new and old places whenever we get the chance. If I could make a living traveling the world, I would do it in a heartbeat. I have a fear of falling and a bad case of claustrophobia. I also get sick at the sight of blood and cannot even think about a needle without wanting to pass out (Yet somehow I have a tattoo). I’m a huge procrastinator and I am honestly surprised I’m almost done planning our wedding. When I’m stressed, I spazz out and have a hard time calming down until I take care of the stressor. I write lists daily of things to do to keep myself on track whether it be at work or at home. I don’t think I have ever completed one of my lists in entirety and I’m sure if you look around you can find a handful of them scattered about. If it were up to me, I would wear jeans and a t-shirt every day, but that doesn’t mean I don’t enjoy the occasional event that calls for something a little dressier. I love being the center of attention, but also like to sit back and people watch. My shower head and steering wheel have always been the unfortunate audience to my lovely singing voice. No matter how terrible of a singer I am, I love to sing. I also really love to dance and I feel like I can do that okay. The only sport I will ever watch is hockey and I am a huge fan of the Nashville Predators. When I go to a game, I always leave unable to talk. I love playing video games and my all time favorite has been Legend of Zelda. Wow, once I got to writing, it wasn’t as hard as I thought to talk about myself.

Kristen's true love (besides me of course) is adventure. Kristen hates to be cooped up indoors most of the time and wants to be out experiencing new things in the world. She loves kayaking, playing sports, blowing bubbles, or even just sitting outside and watching the world go by. Kristen is an amazing mommy to Haley, our puppy, and loves any and all animals. Given the choice of what to do in her life she would choose to live by the beach and volunteer with sea animals, especially sea turtles. Kristen is an incredibly kind-hearted person and would do just about anything to help a friend. Kristen is a great cook and enjoys having a large kitchen, someday when we have a house she wants a kitchen with an island in the middle so that she can have more room to work. It doesnt take a lot to make Kristen happy, a small gesture, talking to her in the middle of the day and asking her how her day is going, or just a simple night in watching a scary movie. Kristen and I have so many things in common in terms of our taste in things such as food, movies (scary movies), and things that we want to try. Kristen and I want to skydive together, visit places outside of the United States, go to the beach whenever we can, and a million other things. Ever since I met Kristen we have been drawn towards each other because of our personalities and shared interests. Kristen has so much that she wants to do in her time here on Earth and as our marriage starts we are going to try and fit it all in! I love Kristen so much and I think that she is an amazing person and I cant wait to be able to call her my wife! <3";

His love of his Xbox makes me question if I may be his #2. The day we adopted our sweet puppy Haley, was the day I saw an even gentler side of him (mess with her and you will have to answer to him).

That describes me perfectly. :-) Seriously though, if i had to describe myself I would do so by telling some 'normal' and some 'random' facts about myself. I love to play sports, particularly soccer, hockey, and volleyball. I played soccer regularly for around 16 years including being captain of my high school and club soccer teams my senior year of high school. My club soccer team won multiple championships in both outdoor and indoor soccer. I love the Nashville Predators and no other hockey team. I am a professional software developer at HealthTrust in Nashville and I absolutely love my team and working there. In a 'True Colors' temperament assessment I am the highest possible score of Orange, meaning it is my heavily dominant color. What that means is that I like to stand out, lead in most situations, have my opinion heard (and feel the need to share it even when people dont want to hear it), and am not heavily into following rules. I like to blaze my own trail. I am heavily loyal to those close to me and would defend them against anyone or anything. I love games of all kinds, made up games, card games, video games, board games, you name it, ill play it! If you challenge me to a first or second generation pokemon battle im probably going to win, unless I play Jed, in which case it is a toss up. I love animals, such as brown bears, giraffes, and puppies. My favorite holiday is Halloween because I get to dress up as whatever I want (and i will never stop). I love the beach and the ocean, when i visit the beach i spend 90% of my time in the water on inflatables (turtles, whales, sharks, you name it), letting waves hit me in the face, and swimming so far out that Kristen gets nervous. I have two tattoos and plan to get more very soon.

We both volunteered during the summers at the Clarksville Montgomery County Public Library. I remember orientation for that summer and seeing this young boy with a really bad haircut. He was one of three guys that volunteered at the library amongst 15 to 20 girls. He wasn’t hard to pick out of the volunteers. We became fast friends and were always excited to see each other every summer to volunteer. Cody was quite the catch at the library, as every girl had their hearts set on him. That made him undesirable in my eyes, as I was constantly hearing each girl tell me how they had a crush on him. I continued to be his friend, but did not want anything more as it was annoying to hear all the girls gush about him to me. We added each other on Facebook and the summer we started dating, we would stay up until late hours just chatting away even though we would be seeing each other the next day. Cody wasn’t as great of a volunteer as I was and would follow me around while I was working hard. I eventually started to develop feelings for him and I had him hooked after one afternoon at Sonic’s happy hour. The first song we ever listened to together was Lonely Island’s “I’m on a Boat” in the Sonic parking lot. I think that should tell you a lot about our relationship! After that, Cody chased me for awhile until he finally got the courage to ask me to be his girlfriend. That was the cutest thing ever, but I’m sure Cody would kill me if I wrote that story out! Ha! That night will live on in my memory forever. I had no clue I was saying yes to my future husband on that Bridge to Nowhere. It was the best thing I have ever said yes to. It definitely was not an easy relationship when we started out. I was in college in Martin and Cody was still in high school back in Clarksville. We were two hours away from each other and only got to see each other on weekends, but we made it work no matter how much we hated being apart. When Cody joined me in college, we were inseparable and made many great memories during our college days. Throughout our relationship, we’ve shared so many amazing milestones together: graduating college, getting our first “adult” jobs, living in 2 apartments, adopting Haley, getting engaged and planning our wedding together. These past nine years have been incredible and I know they are a tiny glimpse at what our married life will be like. I know these next chapters will be filled with laughter, love and adventure, because that is what we have always had. I’m so happy I met Cody when I did, because he has always made life more enjoyable for me. Cheers to the next chapters! I can’t wait to see our love story continue.";
            
            document.getElementById("codyHowDidTheyMeet").innerHTML = "It all began at the public library. Little did I know it was here that I would meet my future wife. Technically, we actually may have met in daycare at the Child Learning Center at APSU in Clarksville, as we both attended daycare there at or around the same time, however the actual for sure meeting we can claim was volunteering at the public library. Here is the day of orientation as I choose to remember it :-) . I walked in and all conversations stopped dead in their tracks. All eyes on me, including Kristen's. From that point on Kristen was hooked, she couldnt get me out of her head for several years and finally she got her wish and I asked her to be my girlfriend! (im really lucky im making this website and Kristen cant argue until you read hers :-) ) In reality though, Kristen and I did meet at the library and we became friends. We saw each other each year we volunteered. I went to a high school dance with another library volunteer and Kristen and we had a lot of fun. We hung out a few times after that and finally we started really talking at the library in the summer of 2009. We went on a few dates and I asked Kristen to be my girlfriend. We spent the entire summer together as much as we could and had an amazing time. I was entering my senior year of high school as she was going to college at the University of Tennessee at Martin for her freshman year. I visited her as much as possible on weekends and she would come to my high school and club soccer games as much as she could. Im not going to lie and say it was easy dating each other even only 2 hours away, it was hard for both of us, with it being my senior year and her freshman year of college, we both gave up quite a lot but we knew we had something very special. The next year I made the decision to go to UTM as well and from then on we were together the vast majority of the time. From there came infinite memories and joint custody of our sweet puppy Haley. I am so excited to marry my Honeypot Kristen and for her to become my wife. ";
            
            document.getElementById("kristenHowDidCodyAsk").innerHTML = "Cody had been talking about a surprise he had for me for a few weeks. He told me the day I needed to not make plans and it happened to be before we were going on our yearly beach trip. I was so excited, cause Cody is not the planning type and I was curious to see what he had come up with. The day before the surprise was supposed to happen, he got a text that due to weather, we weren’t going to be able to go through with his plans. He was upset and trying to find another day. I told him another weekend would be okay with me, as I had no clue what was planned. He agreed and we went to the beach and had a wonderful week soaking up the sun and enjoying Haley’s first beach vacation. When we returned at the end of the week, I was so excited for my surprise to come that Sunday. Cody was anxious as he didn’t know if the weather would yet again cancel his plans. Thankfully the night before, he got the go ahead and told me I’d have to get up early the next morning. Anyone who knows me, knows this is a challenge as I am not a morning person. I was so excited that night, that I barely got a wink of sleep. I woke up 3:30 that Sunday morning to get dressed and ready to see what Cody had in store for me. We arrived at a gas station in Franklin at 5:00 A.M. and my curiosity just kept growing. What could we possibly be doing? When a van pulled up that had Middle Tennessee Hot Air Adventures painted on the side, I had no words! Cody and I had gone to the Franklin Hot Air Balloon Festival back in May and it made me want to take a hot air balloon ride so bad! I didn’t know that day Cody had decided he was going to pop the question that way. I met all the balloon pilots and all the other people who had woken up as early as me to take a hot air balloon ride that morning. Cody also had another surprise for me: He had booked us a private ride so it would just be the two of us! We had to get into a van to ride to the spot we would take off that morning and we got to know our pilot and his wife. Cody was just his normal self and I couldn’t contain my excitement. We made it to the spot we would take off and got to witness and even help set up our hot air balloon. The owner of the company’s wife had recently taken up photography so she was taking our pictures throughout the morning. When our balloon was finally set up, Cody asked her to take our picture in front of it. I had my phone in my hand and was trying to cozy up to Cody for our picture, when he took my phone out of his hand and put it in his pocket. I’m sure I was giving him a confused look as he grabbed both my hands and started talking. I feel bad at this point because my mind started going crazy and my heart started racing because I knew at that moment what was happening. I have no clue what Cody said to me that day, but as soon as he got down on one knee I started crying and when he asked me to marry him, a yes came out immediately. It was the moment I had been waiting for since we had first started dating and he exceeded my expectations. We were the first couple they had ever witnessed to get engaged on the ground. Cody had wanted to ask me when we were in the sky, but after seeing how small the basket was, he wanted to ask me before we took off and I am so glad he did! I was literally on cloud 9 that day and it made my first hot air balloon experience that much more memorable! When we were in the air I pulled a Monica Geller yelling, “I’M ENGAGED!” to all of the sleeping people below me! I took many pictures and could not stop smiling the entire day! After we landed, we had a champagne toast and our pilot made us a mini hot air balloon out the cork from our champagne. Every year it hangs on our Christmas tree. When we got back to the gas station, we called and texted all of our family and friends to tell them the news and everyone was so excited. That’s a day that I will never forget and the day Cody pulled the Ultimate Surprise!";
            
            document.getElementById("codyHowDidCodyAsk").innerHTML = "I waited the exact right amount of time before asking Kristen to marry me! When we are married we will have been together for over 9 years, which despite what Kristen says is the exact right amount of time! :-) When I decided it was time to pop the question I had to think about how I wanted to ask Kristen. I decided that the most fitting way to ask Kristen was to ask her doing something new and exciting, which is a pillar of our relationship, trying new and fun things together! We had talked about going on a hot air balloon ride in the past, but until it was time to decide how to ask her it had never crossed my mind because logistically it was a hard way to ask. I knew that Kristen wanted photos of her engagement and that to go on the hot air ballon ride we would have to be driven to the balloon site by the operators of the hot air balloon company, photos seemed to be a pretty hard thing to figure out how to do. I decided that I would use a Go Pro to take a video and then use the video to extract pictures from it afterwards, then Kristen would also have an engagement video as well! Once I had my idea all that was left was to get Kristen to get her nails done and have a nice outfit without raising too much suspicion. I figured out how to do that and so everything was set the night before, until I realized that literally 8 hours before we left for our engagement day I had no idea what I was going to wear.. Oops.. :-( so I told Kristen that I wanted to have nice pictures for our event the next morning and we went shopping right before stores closed and I managed to find (believe it or not) an exact color match of her dress she was going to wear in my exact size (the only one left in the store of ANY size, not just mine) so you could say I got pretty lucky.. The morning of the engagement I was talking to the hot air ballon people while kristen was out of ear shot and I found out that the owner's wife wanted to be come a professional photographer! Even better she told me she would capture our engagement for us for free and give me the pictures! Talk about getting lucky! The rest of the engagement day went exactly as planned, Kristen was surprised and overjoyed, as were our family and friends! Finally to cap the day off we ended up at Taco Bell for breakfast (Kristen's choice) and the teenage worker bought our breakfast for us! :-) The rest is history!";

We will continue to raise and take care of our crazy, but lovable pup Haley and hope one day she returns the favor (please no nursing homes!). We plan on traveling any chance we get and already have some fun places in mind. Cody will continue on as a developer and one day make enough money so I can stay at home and binge Netflix shows (Thanks Honey!). As for everything else, we will live each day fully and continue to annoy each other until the end of time. We are going to enjoy the ride and see where it takes us. ";

We will be taking her back to the beach, which she absolutely loves. Kristen and I will return home from our honeymoon and decide what adventure we want to start next! We want to visit places out of the country such as Europe and Australia. We have spent the vast majority of our lives in Tennessee so we want to branch out and see the world! We have a few more items to cross off our lists here in Tennessee before we look at other potential places to live. We will continue to support the Nashville Predators on their quest to win the Stanley Cup and go to games whenever we can and support them no matter where we go.

Technically, we actually may have met in daycare at the Child Learning Center at APSU in Clarksville, as we both attended daycare there at or around the same time, however the actual for sure meeting we can claim was volunteering at the public library. Here is the day of orientation as I choose to remember it :-) . I walked in and all conversations stopped dead in their tracks. All eyes on me, including Kristen's. From that point on Kristen was hooked, she could'nt get me out of her head for several years and finally she got her wish and I asked her to be my girlfriend! (im really lucky im making this website and Kristen cant argue until you read hers :-) ) In reality though, Kristen and I did meet at the library and we became friends. We saw each other each year we volunteered. I went to a high school dance with another library volunteer and Kristen and we had a lot of fun. We hung out a few times after that and finally we started really talking at the library in the summer of 2009. We went on a few dates and I asked Kristen to be my girlfriend. We spent the entire summer together as much as we could and had an amazing time. I was entering my senior year of high school as she was going to college at the University of Tennessee at Martin for her freshman year. I visited her as much as possible on weekends and she would come to my high school and club soccer games as much as she could. Im not going to lie and say it was easy dating each other even only 2 hours away, it was hard for both of us, with it being my senior year and her freshman year of college, we both gave up quite a lot but we knew we had something very special. The next year I made the decision to go to UTM as well and from then on we were together the vast majority of the time. From there came infinite memories and joint custody of our sweet puppy Haley. I am so excited to marry my Honeypot Kristen and for her to become my wife. ";
            
            document.getElementById("kristenHowDidCodyAskM").innerHTML = "Cody had been talking about a surprise he had for me for a few weeks. He told me the day I needed to not make plans and it happened to be before we were going on our yearly beach trip. I was so excited, cause Cody is not the planning type and I was curious to see what he had come up with. The day before the surprise was supposed to happen, he got a text that due to weather, we weren’t going to be able to go through with his plans. He was upset and trying to find another day. I told him another weekend would be okay with me, as I had no clue what was planned. He agreed and we went to the beach and had a wonderful week soaking up the sun and enjoying Haley’s first beach vacation. When we returned at the end of the week, I was so excited for my surprise to come that Sunday. Cody was anxious as he didn’t know if the weather would yet again cancel his plans. Thankfully the night before, he got the go ahead and told me I’d have to get up early the next morning. Anyone who knows me, knows this is a challenge as I am not a morning person. I was so excited that night, that I barely got a wink of sleep. I woke up 3:30 that Sunday morning to get dressed and ready to see what Cody had in store for me. We arrived at a gas station in Franklin at 5:00 A.M. and my curiosity just kept growing. What could we possibly be doing? When a van pulled up that had Middle Tennessee Hot Air Adventures painted on the side, I had no words! Cody and I had gone to the Franklin Hot Air Balloon Festival back in May and it made me want to take a hot air balloon ride so bad! I didn’t know that day Cody had decided he was going to pop the question that way. I met all the balloon pilots and all the other people who had woken up as early as me to take a hot air balloon ride that morning. Cody also had another surprise for me: He had booked us a private ride so it would just be the two of us! We had to get into a van to ride to the spot we would take off that morning and we got to know our pilot and his wife. Cody was just his normal self and I couldn’t contain my excitement. We made it to the spot we would take off and got to witness and even help set up our hot air balloon. The owner of the company’s wife had recently taken up photography so she was taking our pictures throughout the morning. When our balloon was finally set up, Cody asked her to take our picture in front of it. I had my phone in my hand and was trying to cozy up to Cody for our picture, when he took my phone out of his hand and put it in his pocket. I’m sure I was giving him a confused look as he grabbed both my hands and started talking. I feel bad at this point because my mind started going crazy and my heart started racing because I knew at that moment what was happening. I have no clue what Cody said to me that day, but as soon as he got down on one knee I started crying and when he asked me to marry him, a yes came out immediately. It was the moment I had been waiting for since we had first started dating and he exceeded my expectations. We were the first couple they had ever witnessed to get engaged on the ground. Cody had wanted to ask me when we were in the sky, but after seeing how small the basket was, he wanted to ask me before we took off and I am so glad he did! I was literally on cloud 9 that day and it made my first hot air balloon experience that much more memorable! When we were in the air I pulled a Monica Geller yelling, “I’M ENGAGED!” to all of the sleeping people below me! I took many pictures and could not stop smiling the entire day! After we landed, we had a champagne toast and our pilot made us a mini hot air balloon out the cork from our champagne. Every year it hangs on our Christmas tree. When we got back to the gas station, we called and texted all of our family and friends to tell them the news and everyone was so excited. That’s a day that I will never forget and the day Cody pulled the Ultimate Surprise!";
            
            document.getElementById("codyHowDidCodyAskM").innerHTML = "I waited the exact right amount of time before asking Kristen to marry me! When we are married we will have been together for over 9 years, which despite what Kristen says is the exact right amount of time! :-) When I decided it was time to pop the question I had to think about how I wanted to ask Kristen. I decided that the most fitting way to ask Kristen was to ask her doing something new and exciting, which is a pillar of our relationship, trying new and fun things together! We had talked about going on a hot air balloon ride in the past, but until it was time to decide how to ask her it had never crossed my mind because logistically it was a hard way to ask. I knew that Kristen wanted photos of her engagement and that to go on the hot air ballon ride we would have to be driven to the balloon site by the operators of the hot air balloon company, photos seemed to be a pretty hard thing to figure out how to do. I decided that I would use a Go Pro to take a video and then use the video to extract pictures from it afterwards, then Kristen would also have an engagement video as well! Once I had my idea all that was left was to get Kristen to get her nails done and have a nice outfit without raising too much suspicion. I figured out how to do that and so everything was set the night before, until I realized that literally 8 hours before we left for our engagement day I had no idea what I was going to wear.. Oops.. :-( so I told Kristen that I wanted to have nice pictures for our event the next morning and we went shopping right before stores closed and I managed to find (believe it or not) an exact color match of her dress she was going to wear in my exact size (the only one left in the store of ANY size, not just mine) so you could say I got pretty lucky.. The morning of the engagement I was talking to the hot air ballon people while kristen was out of ear shot and I found out that the owner's wife wanted to be come a professional photographer! Even better she told me she would capture our engagement for us for free and give me the pictures! Talk about getting lucky! The rest of the engagement day went exactly as planned, Kristen was surprised and overjoyed, as were our family and friends! Finally to cap the day off we ended up at Taco Bell for breakfast (Kristen's choice) and the teenage worker bought our breakfast for us! :-) The rest is history!";
            
            document.getElementById("kristenFutureHoldM").innerHTML = "Cody and I have many things planned for our future. For starters, we will be jetting off to Hawaii, after you have attended the best wedding ever, to celebrate the fact we will be stuck with each other for eternity! Once there, I will try my hardest to convince Cody to move to Hawaii. When we get back from our honeymoon, it will be business as usual as we return to our jobs and everyday lives. We will continue to raise and take care of our crazy, but lovable pup Haley and hope one day she returns the favor (please no nursing homes!). We plan on traveling any chance we get and already have some fun places in mind. Cody will continue on as a developer and one day make enough money so I can stay at home and binge Netflix shows (Thanks Honey!). As for everything else, we will live each day fully and continue to annoy each other until the end of time. We are going to enjoy the ride and see where it takes us. ";
            
            document.getElementById("codyFutureHoldM").innerHTML = "Our new life starts with our wedding day. Once Kristen and I are married we have big plans for the future. A lot of things will change and some will stay the same. We will continue to love and raise our puppy Haley. We have plans to take Haley on many trips and adventures with us. We will be taking her back to the beach, which she absolutely loves. Kristen and I will return home from our honeymoon and decide what adventure we want to start next! We want to visit places out of the country such as Europe and Australia. We have spent the vast majority of our lives in Tennessee so we want to branch out and see the world! We have a few more items to cross off our lists here in Tennessee before we look at other potential places to live. We will continue to support the Nashville Predators on their quest to win the Stanley Cup and go to games whenever we can and support them no matter where we go. Looking into the future what I see is happiness and adventure for us all over the world and new experiences in new places.";
